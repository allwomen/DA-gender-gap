# Welcome to the Data Analytics Masterclass hosted by AllWomen!


Many people say the gender gap in income and occupation levels is overstated all over the world, where some say that inequality in the labor force is a thing of the past. Is there a REAL gender gap at all? Is it stronger in some industries than in others? Let's try to answer all those questions with REAL data! Our goal is to give you a taste of coding with Python with our  Masterclass focused on gender gap content. This showcase will give you an opportunity to open yourself up to the possibilities of data without fear or judgment.
